# LegendOfMaker

A Work in progress for a Zelda like level creator.

## Goals
* Be able to play a Custom Zelda-like games
* Be able to create such games
* Be able to do both of these in a browser, on both computer and mobile
* Be able to share created levels with others.

## Defining a Zelda-like game
* An action-adventure game
** With real time combat, especially with a sword.
** And puzzles, especially block puzzles and finding the right item
* A top down perspective for 2d
* Dungeons
** with a useful tool
** a boss at the end
** and a collectable Macguffin for clearing it.
* An overworld that connects the dungeons
** that requires the items from the dungeon to get to the next one
** with lots of hidden areas to explore with useful collectables.

## What should be built with this?
* a full game with 8 dungeons and a full overworld is a lot to build and play
* a given dungeon can be beaten in 5-30 minutes, depending on skill and complexity.
* therefore, allow users to build and play a dungeon.
* Maybe allow complete games or a limited overworld later.
* Bosses are prebuilt or created by combining additional monsters.
* monsters are from a set of existing monsters, based on Zelda monsters.
